Today you will work in groups on a small research project as part of an Inquiry Activity. First, we will have a set of topical lessons. Then, you will be given a dataset and given a challenge: “Figure out what is in your dataset and Justify it with measurements.” In the afternoon, you will learn about non-linear models. This will help you to measure additional properties about the object in your dataset. Lastly, you will “Tell the Story” of your project and explain how and why you classified the object as you did.
